# ProtTrans
You need to prepare the pretrained language model ProtTrans to run GLMSite:  
Download the pretrained ProtT5-XL-UniRef50 model ([guide](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans)).  
# ESMFold
The protein structures should be predicted by ESMFold to run GLMSite:  
Download the ESMFold model ([guide](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm))  
# Run GLMSite for prediction
Simply run:  
```
